    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 lb phyllo dough</li>
        <li> 1 lb ground beef or lamb</li>
        <li> 1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li> Salt and pepper, to taste</li>

    <p>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a large skillet, heat the 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until
        softened, about 5 minutes.
        Add the ground meat, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook until the meat is browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from
        heat and let cool.
        Lay out the phyllo dough and brush each sheet with the 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.
        Place the meat filling along one edge of the dough and roll the dough into a log, tucking in the sides as you
        go.
        Place the burek in a greased baking dish and brush the top with water. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden
        brown.
