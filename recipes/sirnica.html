        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Sirnica, on the other hand, is a type of Balkan pastry that is similar to burek but is filled with a mixture of cheese, eggs, and sometimes sour cream or yogurt. It is also made with phyllo dough and can be served as a main dish or appetizer. Sirnica has a deliciously rich and creamy flavor thanks to the cheese filling.

        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a bowl, mix together the crumbled feta cheese, beaten eggs, sour cream, and milk.
        Lay out the phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter.
        Place the cheese filling along one edge of the dough and roll the dough into a log, tucking in the sides as you go.
        Place the sirnica in a greased baking dish and brush the top with water. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown.
