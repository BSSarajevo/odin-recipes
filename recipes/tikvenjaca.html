    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a large bowl, mix together the grated pumpkin, chopped walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
        Lay out the phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter.
        Spread a layer of the pumpkin mixture over the first sheet of phyllo dough. Repeat this process, adding layers of phyllo dough and pumpkin mixture until all of the ingredients are used up.
        Roll up the phyllo dough tightly, tucking in the sides as you go.
        Place the tikvenjaca in a greased baking dish and brush the top with water. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown.
        Allow the tikvenjaca to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. This sweet and savory dessert is perfect for enjoying with a cup of coffee or tea on a chilly day.
