    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a large pot, boil the potatoes until tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain and mash the potatoes with a potato masher or fork.
        In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
        Add the mashed potatoes, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let cool.
        In a bowl, mix together the sour cream and milk. Add the cooled potato mixture and stir to combine.
        Lay out the phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter.
        Place the potato filling along one edge of the dough and roll the dough into a log, tucking in the sides as you go.
        Place the krompirusa in a greased baking dish and brush the top with water. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Serve hot as a snack or appetizer.
