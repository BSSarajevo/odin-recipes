    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
        In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
        Add the chopped greens, salt, and pepper. Cook until the greens are wilted, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
        In a bowl, mix together the beaten eggs, sour cream, and milk. Add the cooled greens mixture and stir to combine.
        Lay out the phyllo dough and brush each sheet with melted butter.
        Place the greens filling along one edge of the dough and roll the dough into a log, tucking in the sides as you go.
        Place the zeljanica in a greased baking dish and brush the top with water. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. Serve hot.
